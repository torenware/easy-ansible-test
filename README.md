# easy-ansible-test
This demonstrates a quick Docker Compose set up to get up an ansible host and 3 targets.  Just a demo.  It's based off a hack used 
in Mumshad Mannambeth's Udemy course on Advanced Ansible.  Mumshad has a Docker image that didn't quite work for me, so I "fixed it" with a
couple of Dockerfiles and setting up Docker Compose to use them.
